After having redone [my CV in markdown through GitHub Pages](https://harmtemolder.github.io/cv/), I thought this'd be a great opportunity to get [harmtemolder.nl]({{ site.baseurl }}) live again as well. Nothing special, just my blog. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This post's in English, but others might be in Dutch. I'll have to think of a way to manage that, or just ignore it and let you figure it out with Google Translate.
